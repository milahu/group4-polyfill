# group4-polyfill

decode [Group4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_4_compression) images in a web browser



## status

working prototype



## todo

- test multi-strip images
- test too-large images
- streaming decode (for large TIFFs)
- use TIFF parser from pdfium?
    - [pdfium/core/fxcodec/tiff/tiff_decoder.cpp](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/refs/heads/main/core/fxcodec/tiff/tiff_decoder.cpp)
    - [pdfium/third_party/libtiff/tiff.h](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/refs/heads/main/third_party/libtiff/tiff.h)



## why

the TIFF image format is useful  
to store [binary images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_image) compressed with  
[CCITT Group 4 compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_4_compression)

this binary image compression method  
is already supported in the PDF format  
which is supported by practically all web browsers

it is useful for images of text  
for example scanned book pages  
with single-bit depth (bitonal images)  
and high resolution (usually 600 dpi)

the only usable alternative is the AVIF image format  
but compressing AVIF images  
takes about 100 times more CPU time  
than compressing CCITT-G4 images  
to get similar file size and similar visual quality

binary image compression methods  
are useful for [EPUB-FXL documents](https://github.com/internetarchive/archive-hocr-tools/pull/23)  
(FXL = fixed layout)  
which are similar to PDF documents of scanned book pages  
but implemented in HTML



## limitations



### no file protocol

the polyfill does not work over the file protocol,
because we cannot
[fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
the Group4 image



### requires javascript

the polyfill requires JavaScript ans WebAssembly (WASM)



## complexity

the TIFF image format is terribly complex  
which is probably why it is not-yet supported by chromium  
(high complexity = large attack surface)  
so i would drastically limit the feature set to

- CCITT Group 4 compression
- one strip
- one image
- 1-bit depth only
- size limits (4 GB, max width, max height)

... which allows us to write a minimal TIFF parser  
and integrate an existing CCITT-G4 decoder  
to reduce the attack surface



## browser support

some web browsers already support TIFF images  
probably with different feature sets

- Amaya
- Avast Secure Browser
- Falkon
- Internet Explorer
- Ladybird
- Links
- OmniWeb
- Safari
- Shiira
- WorldWideWeb

... based on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_browsers#Image_format_support

TIFF decoder written in javascript,
also supports CCITT Group 4 compression

many features  
complex = risky

https://github.com/jkriege2/TinyTIFF  
no compression

## alternative container formats

except PDF and TIFF, there are ...



### CALS

### CIT (Intergraph Raster Type 24)

no: closed-source

> Intergraph is a monochrome bitmap format developed by Intergraph. LEADTOOLS supports the RLE and CIT versions of this file format.

> The default extensions used by this format are: ITG and CIT.

> For this file format, LEAD supports CCITT G4 and RLE compression.

> CIT is a widely used format in the MicroStation community. CIT is a special case of Intergraph Raster File Format (INGR) - a 1-bit version with CCITT G4 compression).

chatGPT

> - It was developed by Intergraph (now part of Hexagon Geospatial) for use in their GIS and CAD/raster systems (e.g., MGE, GeoMedia, and related tooling).
> - “Type 24” refers to a specific CIT raster encoding/compression variant used within that ecosystem.
> - The format was designed for internal interoperability within Intergraph software, not as an open standard.

> The format is partially reverse-engineered



## out of scope



### JBIG2 compression

[JBIG2 compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBIG2)
is out of scope,
because JBIG2-compressed images dont need a container format like TIFF,
because JBIG2-compressed images can be standalone image files

```sh
# compress
jbig2 src.png >dst.jbig2

# decompress
jbig2dec -o dst.png src.jbig2
```

CCITT-Group4-compressed images are special,
because the CCITT-Group4 format cannot store image width and height,
so we need a container format like TIFF (or PDF)
